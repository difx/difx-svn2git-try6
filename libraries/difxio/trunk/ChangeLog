3.0
* Includes the following changes merged (hopefully correctly) from the DiFX-1.5 branch;
  - Merge fixes from trunk
  - Add network table infrastructure
  - Load > 1 pulsar polynomial from a file
  - Move flags to DifxJob so combinig multiple subarrays results in accurate
    application of flags.  NOTE: This breaks the API
  - Infrastructure for writing for file-based correlation
  - When sorting antennas, update the scan table (nAntenna, im and model)
  - Fix and simplify DifxInputGetScanIdByAntennaId
  - Fix for parsing of .flag file. 
  - Start some infrastructure for supporting proper flagging in cases of partially
    overlapping scans
  - Add difxcalculator under utils.  This is an implementation of
    http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/difx/difx_calculator.xls
    as a stand-alone program
* Allows support of multiple phase centres in input/calc/im files
* Allows support of zoom bands
* Replaces blockspersend with subintNS
* Shifts numchannels/oversample/decimation etc from Configuration to Freq
* Allows use of Rule table in input file
* Adds support for LO offsets
* Fix memory leak (need to free baseline array)

2.11
* Post DiFX-1.5
* Implement profile mode (with mode=profile at the global level)
* Add writeDifxLineBoolean and use it for writing TRUE/FALSE values

2.10
* Deallocation option of function DifxBaselineAllocPolProds()
  - needed for more flexible frequency selection in vex2difx
* Consider antenna reordering when concattenating scans
* use same mjd rounding for .calc and .input files
* Version for DiFX-1.5

2.9
* Initial support for calculation of spacecraft positions via SPICE

2.8
* Version bump for slight API change
* padDifxScans added to allow extra non-correlation scans to be inserted

2.7
* Version bump for slight API change
* a few important bug fixes
* Add simplify functions for freqs, datastreams, baselines and configs
* separate out internal deallocation from table destructors and force to 0 deallocated arrays

2.6
* Version bump.  Slight change to internal API.  This version is needed for pulsar
  support in vex2difx.

2.5
* Version bump.  This version required now by vex2difx.

2.4 
* Post NRAO-DiFX 1.1 developments
* Ability to write .calc and .input files
* Mass renaming of .c source files
* Determine nPolar smartly -- don't assume based on config name

2.3
* Support new keywords : ABERRATION CORR (.im) and DIFX VERSION (.calc)
* Fix mapping of autocorrelation frequency ids
* Revamp antenna indexing
* support for different ordering of telescopes in the input files
* make summary versions of printing functions
* make fprintf versions of all printing functions
* This is the version for NRAO-DiFX 1.1

2.2
* partial write support.  So far: delay, uvw, rate and im files

2.1
* a possible bug fix
* support for sorting antennas into alpha order

2.0
* some changes needed for difx2fits 2.0.
* implement fits source ids
* bug fixes around the board
* finish initial pulsar support

1.6
* Add support for spacecraft.  Much cleanup of code

1.5
* Add top level parameters to DifxInput that are used specifically for FITS

1.4
* DifxInputGetAntennaId()

1.3
* Load in flag file
* use calloc where appropriate
* support generalized DATA FORMAT

1.2
* Fixed array indexing issue

1.1
* Improved auto*, changed library name a little

1.0 
* Initial version
