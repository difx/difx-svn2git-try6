    <h1>Things To Do<br>
    </h1>
    The following is a partial list of things that need to be done to
    the GUI.<br>
    <h5>Improve Real-Time Monitoring</h5>
    <p>The real-time monitoring system needs some refinements.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently it has a probably-wrong way of calculating what it
        calls "summary" plots.&nbsp; Summaries should be computed on the
        DiFX host using the proper means for amplitude and phase
        individually.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Should be able to compute delay rates, SNR, etc.</li>
      <li>Plots should be broken up by "scan" - currently data are
        combined between scans, which is completely wrong (so real-time
        monitoring only makes sense for jobs that contain a single
        scan).</li>
      <li>Real-time monitoring should work for more than one job at a
        time (probably involves changes to DiFX software).</li>
      <li>"Quit at 80%" problem needs to be fixed (also DiFX
        software...)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Automated Run Scheme</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Jobs should pick data sources and processors that make sense
        for the job, resources available, etc.</li>
      <li>User should be able to select and run a number of jobs at once
        (they'd run however the user set them up to run, or with
        sensible choices for data source and processors - see bullet #1
        - if the user didn't bother doing that).</li>
      <li>Have GUI learn the most efficient way to use the existing DiFX
        cluster??</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Secure Communications</h5>
    <p>TCP connections between the GUI and <i>guiServer</i> are not
      secure, thus they (in general) can't work over anything but a
      secure LAN.&nbsp; Not as easy as it sounds to fix - there are many
      TCP connections made.<br>
    </p>
    <h5>Other</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>GUI does not recognize CalcServer not running (common problem)
        gracefully.&nbsp; Should do so, allow user to start it, etc.</li>
      <li>How well do multiple GUI's running at once work (relaying of
        broadcast messages, etc)?&nbsp; Broadcast message collection
        should probably be done once, and distributed to all connected
        GUI's (currently I think it is done once for each).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The database stuff needs to be modernized - hasn't been
        touched in over a year, might not work.</li>
      <li>Mark 5 directory stuff is spotty - sometimes it works,
        sometimes it doesn't.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
