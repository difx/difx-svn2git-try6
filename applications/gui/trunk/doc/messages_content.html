    <h1>Message Windows<br>
    </h1>
    The DiFX GUI provides a number of "message" windows that contain
    notifications from the GUI itself or from DiFX processes.&nbsp;
    Messages come in the typical three flavors:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Information</b> messages that draw attention to activities
        that may help monitor the progress of processing or have other
        value, but which require no action on the part of the
        user.&nbsp; Information messages are rendered with white text.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Warning</b> messages indicate the detection of a possible
        problem, but one that does not stop processing, or occasionally
        draw attention to "major" processing steps (such as the
        triggering of a DiFX process).&nbsp; The are shown in yellow
        text.</li>
      <li><b>Error</b> messages usually indicate a fatal problem that
        has, or is likely to stop processing.&nbsp; They are colored
        red.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
