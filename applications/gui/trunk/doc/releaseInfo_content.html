    <h1>DiFX GUI Release Information</h1>
    This is a description of the changes most recently introduced to the
    DiFX GUI as well of a history of all such past changes.&nbsp;
    Changes listed are organized by GUI version number (the version
    number appears in the title bar of the GUI).&nbsp; Attempts will be
    made to include all changes made between version numbers although
    nothing is promised.<br>
    <br>
    The version numbering scheme is, at present, unique to the GUI - it
    does not follow the version number of the rest of the DiFX software
    (which has a little more formality behind it).&nbsp; Before the
    introduction of this help page the GUI was stuck on the bogus
    place-holder version number "0.8".&nbsp; As a first attempt to make
    the version number actually mean something I am starting at
    "1.0".&nbsp; New releases will increment the fractional portion of
    the release number by hundredths (the next versions will be "1.01",
    then "1.02", etc) unless they are considered "major" releases in
    which case the integer portion will be incremented.&nbsp; What
    constitutes a major release is yet to be determined, but presumably
    they happen at least as often as every hundred "minor" releases or
    this system collapses.<br>
    <h4><a name="WHATS_NEW"></a>Latest Release: 1.0 (Oct 30, 2012)</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <h6>New Features</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduction of an actual release number and release notes.</li>
        <li>Generalize "data source" selection in Job Editor/Monitor to
          <i>properly</i> accommodate modules, files and network sources.<br>
        </li>
        <li>.input files are parsed (reasonably completely).&nbsp; This
          allows some of the features above.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The usual smattering of documentation updates.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Bug Fixes</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Concurrent modification exception prevented complete
          deletion of experiments (sometimes).</li>
        <li>Sort processor/Mark5 node names in hardware display.</li>
        <li>Updates of data source information no longer require
          redrawing all data source information (which led to screen
          flicker).</li>
        <li>Fix scrolling bug in IndexedPanel displays (scrollbar would
          not immediately update in response to panel opening/closing).</li>
        <li>VSN name changes were not updating .v2d file content.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
