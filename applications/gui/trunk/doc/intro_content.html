    <h1>Overview of the DiFX GUI</h1>
    The DiFX GUI was developed at the United States Naval Observatory as
    a front end to the DiFX software correlator.&nbsp; It was designed
    to minimize the effort required to conduct "normal" correlation
    tasks while maintaining the flexibility sophisticated operators
    require for unique or unusual operations.<br>

    </ul>
    <h3><a name="WHERE_TO_FIND_IT"></a>Where to Find the DiFX GUI</h3>
    The DiFX GUI is part of the DiFX software tree, currently located in
    the sub-directory:<br>
    <pre><tt>	applications/gui/trunk</tt></pre>
    This is the path to the directory containing the <i>guiServer </i>executable:<br>
    <pre>	applications/gui/trunk/guiServer/src<br></pre>
    The Java archive (".jar") file used to run the GUI itself:<br>
    <pre>	applications/gui/trunk/gui/dist/gui.jar<br></pre>
    And the top-level of this documentation:<br>
    <pre>	applications/gui/trunk/doc/intro.html<br></pre>
    Some of these are not ideal locations and will likely change in the
    near future.&nbsp;
    <h3><a name="RUNNING_THE_GUI"></a>Running the GUI</h3>
    There are two components to the DiFX GUI, the user interface itself
    and a <i>guiServer</i> application that runs on one of the
    processing nodes in the DiFX cluster, serving as the primary
    communications conduit between the GUI and DiFX proper.&nbsp; The
    processor running <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    is often referred to in this documentation as the "DiFX Host" or
    (occasionally and somewhat incorrectly) as the&nbsp; "DiFX head
    node" (see below).&nbsp; <i>GuiServer </i>must by run by a user
    (not root for security reasons) that has read and write permissions
    over all data directories used by DiFX.&nbsp; This user must also be
    able to start processes on all other nodes using <span
      style="font-style: italic;">mpirun</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <i>GuiServer</i> is run from the command line on the DiFX Host:<br>
    <pre>	guiServer [PORT #]
</pre>
    The optional port number is the TCP connection port.&nbsp; If it is
    not specified, guiServer will use a default port number (it uses the
    value given by the DIFX_MESSAGE_PORT environment variable, or 50200
    if that is not available).&nbsp; As soon as it is started, guiServer
    will give a message indicating the port it is using:<br>
    <pre>	server at port 50200
</pre>
    The GUI itself is a Java program, currently called <span
      style="font-style: italic;">DiFXUIs</span> (this name is
    historical and will hopefully be changed some day).&nbsp; It can be
    run anywhere that a network connection to the DiFX cluster is
    available (not necessarily on the LAN of the DiFX cluster) on any
    platform that can run Java using its ".jar" file:<br>
    <pre>	java -jar gui.jar<br></pre>
    Once the GUI is running, the address of the DiFX Host (where <span
      style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> is running) and the
    port number (what <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    told you above) can be entered to connect the two.&nbsp; See <a
href="file:///Users/johnspitzak/NetBeansProjects/doi/USNO/doc/settings_content.html#DiFX_Control_Connection">DiFX


      Control Connection</a> in the Settings documentation for
    details.&nbsp; The GUI and <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    can be started in any order - the GUI will connect as soon as a <span
      style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> becomes
    available.&nbsp; Any number of GUI sessions can be run
    simultaneously using the same <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>.<br>
    <h3><a name="WHAT_IT_DOES"></a>What the GUI Does<br>
    </h3>
    The USNO GUI serves two purposes:<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">DiFX Cluster Monitor</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI monitors and displays the
      health and activity of DiFX cluster components (processors, Mark5
      units, etc) and shows the progress of DiFX jobs running on the
      cluster.&nbsp; In this capacity it is essentially a passive
      observer, serving as a somewhat more colorful replacement to the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">errormon</span>, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">mk5mon</span> and <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cpumon</span> scripts that come with
      DiFX.<br>
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Experiment/Job Administrator</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI can also be used to create
      runnable jobs from "raw" data - scans and<span style="font-family:
        Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span> vex file content.&nbsp;
      Files required to run DiFX and directories for data products are
      all created according to user specifications, and jobs are
      organized in "Experiments" and "Passes", all of which can be
      stored using a database.&nbsp; The GUI can then instruct DiFX to
      process these jobs, and will then monitor their progress and data
      products in detail.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3> Structure and Communication</h3>
    <h4> What is the Difference Between the DiFX "Host" and the DiFX
      "Head Node"?</h4>
    <p>This documentation, as well as the GUI itself, can use one or
      another of two terms: "DiFX Host"; and "DiFX Head Node" that
      appear, on first examination, to refer to the same thing.&nbsp; It
      is mostly, but not strictly true that they are the same.&nbsp; The
      DiFX "Host" is, by rigid definition, the DiFX cluster processor
      that is running <i>guiServer</i>.&nbsp; This meaning originated
      in the DiFX GUI software and documentation, and these are the only
      places it applies (any use of "DiFX Host" elsewhere in the DiFX
      documentation, none of which I am aware of, may well indicate
      something different).&nbsp; The DiFX "Head Node", on the other
      hand, is the DiFX cluster processor that initiates multi-core
      processing and collects and collates&nbsp; the results
      therefrom.&nbsp; The "Head Node" moniker is used throughout the
      DiFX documentation.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Usually these two names indicate the same processor - <i>guiServer</i>
      runs on the same machine that initiates multi-core
      processing.&nbsp; This arrangement makes a lot of sense from an
      administrative and CPU load-balancing point of view.&nbsp; However
      it is not a requirement, and the GUI has provisions for specifying
      a "Head Node" that is not the same as the DiFX "Host".<br>
