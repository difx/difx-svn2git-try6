    This document contains an end-to-end description of how the DiFX
    user interface can be used to run DiFX jobs.&nbsp; All steps in the
    process are described in roughly the sequence they would be employed
    in actually running a job.&nbsp; Because the GUI has many options
    that can cause branching paths in step-by-step instructions, what
    follows is only a description of a "sample" procedure for running a
    job.&nbsp; The specific needs of individual users, data and
    installations will likely require approaches that differ some, or
    possibly a lot.&nbsp; With this in mind, links are provided to other
    sections of the documentation that may provide additional details on
    each subject.<br>
    <br>
    This document is <i>not</i> a comprehensive tutorial on all of the
    functionality of DiFX itself.&nbsp; A good place to start looking
    for that sort of thing is <a
      href="http://cira.ivec.org/docuwiki/doku.php/difx/start">here</a>.<br>
    <h3><a name="Startup"></a>Startup</h3>
    Starting the GUI and setting up a connection such that it can
    control DiFX is a multi-stage process.&nbsp; Some components of DiFX
    should be running for the GUI to properly communicate with it.<br>
    <h5>Assure Necessary DiFX Components Are Running</h5>
    <p><i><b>guiServer</b></i><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b><i>mk5daemon</i></b><br>
      <br>
      The actual processing components of DiFX are started on the fly as
      they are needed, however a properly configured DiFX installation
      will have some light-impact processes that are running
      constantly.&nbsp; Specifically important for the GUI, the <i>mk5daemon</i>
      process should be running on all DiFX hardware components
      (processors, MK5 units, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to run DiFX using the GUI with <i>mk5daemon</i>
      absent on some or all components, but this is not a subject
      covered here.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>monitor_server</i></b><i><br>
      </i><br>
      If you wish to monitor running jobs through the GUI's real-time
      plotting capabilities, the DiFX application <i>monitor_server</i>
      needs to be running.&nbsp; This program provides a TCP server at
      whichreal-time data from running DiFX processes can be
      obtained.&nbsp; The absence of this process is not usually a
      problem - if you request the real-time plotting it should be
      started automatically.&nbsp; However if you find that real-time
      plotting isn't working, this could be a cause.&nbsp; For details,
      see the<a href="realtime_monitor_content.html"> Real-Time Monitor
        Documentation</a>.<br>

    <h5>Starting the GUI and Connecting to DiFX</h5>

    </p>
    <h3><a name="Some_Important_Settings"></a>Some Important Settings</h3>
    <p>The GUI has many options the user can set to govern processing,
      how data are stored, and where necessary components are
      located.&nbsp; Most of these needn't be touched on a job-by-job
      basis as long as the GUI is running smoothly and appears to be
      doing things correctly.&nbsp; Below is a list of some of the
      settings that are more likely to require user changes.&nbsp; A
      comprehensive list of settings and their options is contained in
      the <a href="settings_content.html">Settings Documentation</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that settings are preserved between GUI sessions, so once
      you have things set up and running properly you should be able to
      restart the GUI and have it run properly right away.<br>

    <h5>The Contents of the Queue Browser</h5>
    <p>The Queue Browser organizes DiFX jobs under a three-level
      hierarchy with "Experiments" at the top level.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <b>Experiment</b> is usually bound to a single data set
        (one or more scans) collected over a specific time span - the
        results of a single observing session for instance.&nbsp; It can
        contain any number of "Passes" (including zero).</li>
      <li>A <b>Pass</b> is used to contain a single analysis of a
        subset of the data.&nbsp; Often Experiments contain a "Clock
        Pass" run on a few scans to generate the time delays for each
        involved antenna, and a "Production Pass" run on all scans with
        those time delays in place.</li>
      <li>Within each Pass is a series of <b>Jobs</b>, each controlling
        the processing of at least one scan.&nbsp; DiFX is run on one
        Job at a time.<br>
      </li>
