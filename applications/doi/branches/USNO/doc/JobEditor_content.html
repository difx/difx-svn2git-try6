This window, which can be produced by picking the    "Control/Monitor for [JOB NAME]" option in the Job menu (right click on a    job in the Queue browser to raise this menu), contains all items required to    tailor a DiFX job, and controls to actually run and monitor it.<br>    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>    </span>Like<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>many DiFX GUI windows,    the Control/Monitor Window is organized into "Sections" that can be opened    or closed depending on whether you are interested in the details they    contain.&nbsp; To open a section, click on its title bar.&nbsp; Click in the    same location to close it.<br>    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>    <h3>"Input File" Section</h3>    <p>This section has an editable window containing the text of the DiFX      "input" file - the file read by <span style="font-style:        italic;">difx</span> that governs a run.&nbsp; There is also a field      showing the full path to the input file on the DiFX host, and two buttons:<br>    </p>    <ol>      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> uploads the exact context        of the text window to the DiFX host and places it in the location given        by the full path.&nbsp; This can be done if any hand-editing changes        have been made to the Input file (see the warning below about        edits!).&nbsp; Unless this button is pushed, any editing changes you        have made will have no effect.<br>      </li>      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh</span> obtains the contents        of the file (given by the full path) on the DiFX host and puts it in the        editable text window.&nbsp; This can be done if you make changes that        you don't like or are unsure of.&nbsp; All of your changes will be        lost.&nbsp; Note that "Refresh" can only undo changes made since that        last "Save".<br>      </li>    </ol>    <span style="font-style: italic;">Warning:</span>&nbsp; The text field    allows you to edit the Input file, but remember that <span style="font-style: italic;">difx</span>    depends on this file to run properly.&nbsp; Because the original is    automatically generated there is not a lot of format-checking of the content    or clear and concise error reporting if anything you put in there is    incorrect - <span style="font-style: italic;">difx</span> may just blow    up.&nbsp; Don't mess around with this file unless you really know what you    are doing.<br>    <h3>"Calc File" Section</h3>    <p>This section is identical to the "Input File" section except that it      holds the "calc" file (used for...uh...what is it used for?).&nbsp; The      same controls are available and the same warnings apply.<br>    </p>    <h3>"Machines List" Section</h3>    <p>The Machines List section provides controls that can be used to select      the data sources and processors used to process the job.&nbsp; Selections      are used to produce "Machines" and "Threads" files on the DiFX host which      are used by <i>mpirun</i> to control multiprocessing.&nbsp; The Machines      and Threads files can be generated using the "Apply" button (and then      examined in the "Machines File" and "Threads File" sections as outlined      below), or they will be produced when the job is started.</p>    <blockquote>      <h5>Machines List Options<br>      </h5>    </blockquote>    <dl>    </dl>    <blockquote>      <dl>        <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choose Data Source Based on Module</span></dt>        <dd>When this option is checked, the GUI will attempt to pick Mark 5          data sources that contain the modules required for the job.&nbsp; If          the proper modules are not present they will appear in red in the data          source list (under the "Modules" column), but with no associated data          source.&nbsp; If you are not using Mark 5 modules as your data source,          this option will have no effect.</dd>      </dl>    </blockquote>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <blockquote>      <dl>        <dt><b>Eliminate Non-Responding Processors</b></dt>        <dd>When <i>guiServer</i> on the DiFX host creates the Machines and          Threads files, it will run a quick check on each processor and data          source (if applicable) to make sure it has the proper permissions to          execute an <i>mpirun</i> on the specific host.&nbsp; If a processor          fails this test and this option is selected, it will be automatically          removed from the list of processors used on the job.<br>        </dd>      </dl>    </blockquote>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <dl>    </dl>    <blockquote>      <dl>        <dt><b>Eliminate Processors Over ____ % Busy</b></dt>        <dd>This option will de-select any processors that have more than a          given percentage of their CPU time consumed.<br>        </dd>      </dl>    </blockquote>    <h3>"Machines File" Section</h3>    <p>Slightly different - changes to the "Machines List" settings will cause      the regeneration of this file.<br>    </p>    <h3>"Threads File" Section</h3>    <p>more of the same<br>    </p>    <h3>"Run Controls" Section <br>    </h3>    <p>This section contains the controls for starting and stopping jobs.<br>    </p>    <h3>Status Bar</h3>    <p>The Status Bar contains the current run state of the job.&nbsp; Progress      and some simple information are included.&nbsp; This section has no label,      and cannot be opened or closed.&nbsp; It resides just below the "Run      Controls" section.<br>    </p>    <h3>Real Time Monitors</h3>    <p>The Real Time Monitors section can be used to produce plots of job output      data as they are produced (reasonably close to real time).&nbsp; Some      first-level analysis can also be done.&nbsp; The primary aim of these      plots is not to produce final, reduced results, but to quickly give the      user an idea whether a job was a success, or in what ways its parameters      need to be adjusted to make it better.<br>    </p>    <h3>Message Monitor</h3>    <p>The message monitor captures and displays all messages that relate to the      job.<br>      <br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:        bold;"></span></p>    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>    <p></p>  </body></html>
