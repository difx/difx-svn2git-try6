    <h1>Pass Editor<br>
    </h1>
    The Pass Editor is used to view and change the settings associated
    with a single pass.&nbsp; A pass is a collection of "jobs" which are
    generated with a single run of the DiFX program <span
      style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span>.&nbsp; Most of the
    settings available in the Pass Editor end up in a single DiFX <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">.v2d</span> file.&nbsp; This file
    is used by <span style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span> to
    make adjustments when converting a <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">.vex</span> file into DiFX <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">.input</span> files, from which jobs can be run.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      Possibly some more information should be included here....<br>
