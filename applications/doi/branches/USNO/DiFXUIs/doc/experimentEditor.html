    <h1>Experiment Editor<br>
    </h1>
    The Experiment Editor allows you to create a new DiFX experiment (or
    "session"), optionally containing a pass and/or a list of
    jobs.&nbsp; It also allows an existing experiment to be edited and
    new passes and job sets to be created.&nbsp; All directory
    structures and files associated with the experiment are created on
    the DiFX host, as well as in the DiFX database (if it is being
    used), and the experiment, pass(es), and job(s) are listed on the
    Queue Browser on the GUI from where DiFX can be run.<br>
    <br>
    The Experiment Editor is launched either to create a new experiment
    (by picking "New-&gt;Experiment" from the Queue Browser) in which
    case its title is "Create New Experiment", or to edit an existing
    experiment (by right-clicking on the experiment name in the Queue
    Browser and choosing "Edit Properties") in which case its title is
    "Edit Experiment Properties".&nbsp; While the controls are
    identical, applying changes to an existing experiment has slightly
    different effects than those applied to a new experiment, as
    described below.<br>
    <h3>Some General Information</h3>
    <p>The experiment name, ID, directory, and some other items are used
      to uniquely identify an experiment and to access it in the
      database.&nbsp; Some of these items are not changed after the
      experiment is created, others can be but generally aren't, and
      some are meant to be changed.&nbsp; They are contained in the top
      section of Experiment Editor.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span><br>
      This is the name of the experiment which appears in the Queue
      Browser.&nbsp; When an experiment is initially created, a default
      name will be generated - a combination of the word "Experiment"
      and the ID number.&nbsp; It can be changed to reflect something
      that better describes the experiment to the user.&nbsp; Due to
      restrictions imposed by the database, a 20 character limit is
      placed on the name length.&nbsp; Changes to the name are
      propagated to the "Directory" and ".vex File" parameters, unless
      those items have been previously changed (you have to hit return
      to make changes do this).<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number</span><br>
      The number is contained in the database, and I'm not sure what it
      is.&nbsp; I'll get back to you on this one.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Status</span><br>
      The status describes the current state of the experiment<span
        style="font-style: italic;"></span>.&nbsp; No doubt this will be
      used by the GUI in the future, but for the moment it is simply
      something the user can set for their own tracking purposes.&nbsp;
      If the database is being used the options permitted by the
      database are given for status.&nbsp; If no database is being used
      the status currently doesn't work and can't be changed, but
      ultimately a way of allowing the user to specify their own status
      strings will be implemented.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In Database</span><br>
      This check box will determine whether the experiment is put in the
      database (or already is there if already created).&nbsp; If the
      database is not being used, this item should remain
      unchecked.&nbsp; An experiment that was not, for whatever reason,
      originally created with this item checked can later be put in the
      database by checking it when in edit mode.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Database ID</span><br>
      This is the ID used by the database to track this
      experiment.&nbsp; When an experiment is initially created, a
      "guess" for this number is generated (usually it is a pretty good
      guess).&nbsp; Later if the experiment is edited the number will
      accurately reflect the ID used by the database.&nbsp; If the
      database is not being used, it is simply a (hopefully unique)
      generated number.&nbsp; This number cannot be changed by the user.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Created</span><br>
      This is the creation time and date for the experiment.&nbsp; When
      initially created, this is the local time of the GUI host.&nbsp;
      Once the experiment is put in the database, this time will change
      (hopefully not much) to reflect the creation time on the database
      host.&nbsp; This is not a user-settable item.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Directory</span><br>
      This is the "working directory" on the DiFX host under which all
      files and sub-directories associated with an experiment
      reside.&nbsp; It should be an absolute (not relative) pathname -
      starting with a "/".&nbsp; When an experiment is created, this
      directory is created (if necessary).&nbsp; If this parameter is
      later changed, it will cause the directory to be moved on the DiFX
      host.&nbsp; For either of these operations to occur, the DiFX user
      must have permission to do them on the DiFX host.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">.vex File</span><br>
      This is the name of the <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span>
      file that will be stored (if creating a new experiment) or is
      already stored (if editing an experiment) under the working
      directory.&nbsp; A session of the Experiment Editor may work with
      only one <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file
      at a time, however any number of <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">.vex</span> files may be associated with an
      experiment.&nbsp; The data stored in the <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file is obtained
      using the "Get .vex File Content" as described in the next
      section.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you already have a <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span>
      file associated with an experiment and wish to create a new one,
      enter a new name in this field and obtain new content using "Get
      .vex File Content".&nbsp; If you have several <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> files associated
      with an experiment and wish to use a previous one, the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Previous Files</span> button can be
      used to load it.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Getting <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> File
      Content</h3>
    <p>An experiment is associated with at least one <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file - in most cases
      only one (although more can be added).&nbsp; The <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file, which is
      provided with a set of observations, contains a complete
      description of the observing session, including times,
      frequencies, antennas uses, sources observed, and scans collected
      (as well as other things).&nbsp; The GUI uses the <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file to provide the
      user with the options that may be applied to tailor DiFX
      processing of the observations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you are creating a new experiment, you need a <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file before you can
      go anywhere.&nbsp; Under "Get .vex File Content", the Experiment
      Editor provides you with a number of ways of obtaining .vex file
      data, including:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Grabbing a file from a location on the DiFX Host.</li>
      <li>Obtaining a file via HTTP.</li>
      <li>Obtaining a file via FTP.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Using a file on the GUI Host.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Copying a file used in another experiment.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Creating a New Pass (or not!)</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combine Scans in One Job</span><br>
      The GUI can create jobs out of the specified scans in one of two
      ways, either as a series of individual scans with one job per
      scan, or a single job containing all scans.&nbsp; Those who know <span
        style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span> well will recognize
      this as a slight change from what it does.&nbsp; <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Vex2difx</span> can be set to create
      single-scan jobs, but otherwise it arranges scans in one or more
      jobs based on the "maxGap" parameter - breaking into new jobs only
      when the gap between two correlations exceeds this value.&nbsp; In
      fact, the GUI essentially cheats by setting the "maxGap" parameter
      to something huge so scans are never broken into more than one
      job.<br>
