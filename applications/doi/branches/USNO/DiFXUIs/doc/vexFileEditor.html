    <h1>.vex File Editor<br>
    </h1>
    The Vex File Editor allows you to locate, create, view and edit <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> files.&nbsp; At least
    in theory - not much has been done yet.&nbsp; Moreover, this
    documentation is crap.<br>
    <h3>Generating a New <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span>
      File</h3>
    <p>There are a number of ways you can generate a <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file, either as a
      final product or a template for hand-editing.&nbsp; These include:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Getting the file associated with the observations for your
        experiment, either directly or by using <span
          style="font-style: italic;">sked</span>.&nbsp; This is
        probably the most common way of doing this, as it is the
        easiest.</li>
      <li>Copying the file from another experiment.</li>
      <li>Grabbing one from a location on the DiFX Host. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Filling in all of the information by hand using the
        editor.&nbsp; This is probably the most error-prone, not to
        mention painful method.</li>
    </ol>
