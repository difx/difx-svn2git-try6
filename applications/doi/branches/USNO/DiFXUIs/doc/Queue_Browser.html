    <h2>Queue Browser</h2>
    In the database, jobs are organized in a hierarchy of "experiments",
    "passes", and "jobs", a structure that is reflected in the Queue
    Browser.&nbsp; Experiments are essentially a "user-based"
    organization - they allow the user to collect a bunch of correlation
    activities under a common heading - for instance all correlations
    related to a particular study (thus the "experiment" title).&nbsp;
    An experiment can contain any number of passes, and they don't have
    to be related in any particular way (its up to the user).&nbsp; A
    pass corresponds to a single ".v2d" and ".vex" file set (where most
    parameters governing software correlation appear).&nbsp; In the
    "staging area" file structure of the software correlator a unique
    directory is assigned to each pass (and they share a name).&nbsp;
    This directory will contain all of the files related to the pass and
    its child jobs.&nbsp; Jobs correspond to unique ".input" files which
    are generated by <span style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span>
    in the staging area.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    You can, if you wish, completely ignore the database - it doesn't
    even have to exist on your software correlator.&nbsp; The Queue
    Browser will still create jobs with the same experiment/pass/job
    hierarchy.<br>
