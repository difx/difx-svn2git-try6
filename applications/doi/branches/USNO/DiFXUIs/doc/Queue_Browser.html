    <h2>Queue Browser</h2>
    In the database, jobs are organized in a hierarchy of "experiments",
    "passes", and "jobs", a structure that is reflected in the Queue
    Browser.&nbsp; Experiments are essentially a "user-based"
    organization - they allow the user to collect a bunch of correlation
    activities under a common heading - for instance all correlations
    related to a particular study (thus the "experiment" title).&nbsp;
    An experiment can contain any number of passes, and they don't have
    to be related in any particular way (its up to the user).&nbsp; A
    pass corresponds to a single ".v2d" and ".vex" file set (where most
    parameters governing software correlation appear).&nbsp; In the
    "staging area" file structure of the software correlator a unique
    directory is assigned to each pass (and they share a name).&nbsp;
    This directory will contain all of the files related to the pass and
    its child jobs.&nbsp; Jobs correspond to unique ".input" files which
    are generated by <span style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span>
    in the staging area.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    You can, if you wish, completely ignore the database - it doesn't
    even have to exist on your software correlator.&nbsp; The Queue
    Browser will still create jobs with the same experiment/pass/job
    hierarchy.<br>

    <h4>Creating a New Experiment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">In Data Base</span> indicates
        whether or not this experiment is to be contained in the DiFX
        data base on the data base server.&nbsp; You may not have a DiFX
        data base or you may not be using it, in which case this item
        will not be checked.&nbsp; If you think you <span
          style="font-style: italic;">are</span> using the data base and
        the item is not checked the GUI was unable to communicate with
        the data base server, which might indicate your data base
        connection parameters are bad (these parameters are set in the
        Settings Window - see Data Base Settings).</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Base ID</span> is a
        unique number assigned to each experiment by the DiFX data base
        server software.&nbsp; If <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
          Data Base</span> is checked, this field will initially be
        blank (as the data base has yet to assign a number).&nbsp; If <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">In Data Base</span> is <span
          style="font-style: italic;">not</span> checked, the GUI will
        attemp to assign a unique ID on its own.<span style="font-style:
          italic;"></span><br>
