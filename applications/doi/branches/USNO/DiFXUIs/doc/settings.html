    <h1>DiFX GUI System Settings Window</h1>
    The DiFX GUI System Settings window contains all user-editable
    parameters that control the configuration and appearance of the GUI,
    as well as its communication with the core DiFX software.&nbsp; The
    System Settings are organized in a browse-able hierarchy of
    "sub-topics" that can be opened and closed as needed.&nbsp;
    Sub-topics include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Settings File</li>
      <li>Broadcast Network</li>
      <li><a href="#Database_Configuration">Database Configuration</a></li>
      <li>Documentation Locations</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Database_Configuration"></a>Database Configuration</h2>
    Trouble?&nbsp; See <a href="#Testing_the_Database_Configuration"><span
        style="font-style: italic;">Trouble-shooting the Database
        Configuration</span></a>.<br>
    <br>
    The Database Configuration settings control the access the GUI has
    to the DiFX database on the DiFX host.&nbsp; The DiFX database
    contains settings and status for all queued experiments, passes, and
    jobs that appear in the Queue Browser window.&nbsp; It is a mySQL
    database that allows remote access via a network connection (it can
    also be consulted directly by running a mySQL client program on the
    DiFX host).&nbsp; The following fields govern remote access to the
    database:<br>
    <h4>Host</h4>
    The database Host is the hostname of the DiFX host that contains the
    DiFX database.&nbsp; The named host should be accessible through
    normal network connections, and the hostname itself must be
    recognized by the name lookup scheme on the GUI machine.&nbsp; The <a
      href="#Database_Ping_Test">ping test</a> can be used to test the
    hostname.<br>
    <h4>User</h4>
    The User is mySQL username for the DiFX database.&nbsp; This is the
    name you would use when running the mySQL client on the DiFX host as
    follows:<br>
    <pre>mysql -u USER<br></pre>
    It does not necessarily match the username you may use to log into
    the DiFX host.&nbsp; The mySQL database must be set up to recognize
    this user, <span style="font-style: italic;">including access to
      the database from the host where the DiFX GUI is running</span>.&nbsp;







    See <a href="#Database_Remote_Access">Problems with Database Remote
      Access</a> in the trouble-shooting section for details.<br>
    <h4>Password</h4>
    This is the password for the username in the mySQL database.&nbsp;
    This is the password you would use when prompted by the mySQL client
    on the DiFX host.&nbsp; This password is set by the mySQL
    administrator or by the user through the mySQL client.&nbsp; It is
    not necessarily the same password you would use to log into the DiFX
    host.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
    <h4>DifX Database</h4>
    The DifX Database is the name of the database that contains the DiFX
    queue.&nbsp; At the time of this writing the rest of the DiFX
    software (difxqueue, etc) uses the database named "difxdb", so that
    is the default value for this field.&nbsp; It probably shouldn't be
    changed.&nbsp; However it is easy to imagine a situation where
    different queues might have different names, so the option of
    changing the database has been included.&nbsp; The GUI software
    implements this option - if you change "difxdb" to something else,
    database access will probably break for the time being.<br>
    <h4>JDBC Driver</h4>
    This is the "driver" used by Java to give the GUI access to the
    mySQL database.&nbsp; It probably should not be changed (the field
    is included to ease transitions between other database software -
    Oracle, etc. - although there are other problems associated with
    changing database types).<br>
    <h4>JDBC Port</h4>
    The JDBC Port is the port over which remote communication with the
    mySQL database occurs.&nbsp; The default port for most mySQL
    installation is 3306, so that is probably what you should be setting
    yours to.&nbsp; Consult the <code>/etc/services</code> file on the
    DiFX host to find out which port is being used.<br>
    <h2><a name="Testing_the_Database_Configuration"></a>Trouble-shooting







      the Database Configuration</h2>
    A number of things can go wrong when trying to access the DiFX
    database remotely.&nbsp; The Database Configuration panel contains a
    few tests that can be used to troubleshoot the database connection.<br>
    <h3><a name="Database_Ping_Test"></a>Ping Test</h3>
    The Ping Test is run by hitting the "Ping Host" button.&nbsp; It can
    be used to establish two things:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Can the name for the DiFX host be resolved - i.e. does the
        host name make any sense?</li>
      <li>Is the host reachable with the current network configuration -
        i.e. is it out there?</li>
    </ol>
    The Ping Test performs attempts six "pings" of the named host,
    reporting the results in the results panel.&nbsp; A successful ping
    test will return statistics for each of the pings along with an
    overall statistical summary:<br>
    <br>
    <img style=" width: 476px; height: 196px;" alt=""
      src="images/settings/good_ping_test.gif"><br>
    <br>
    Ping Test failures will produce alarming red text in the results
    panel.&nbsp; The reported failure should give you an idea what is
    wrong.&nbsp; For instance, the following indicates that the given
    hostname cannot be resolved, either by your local host table or by
    your name server:<br>
    <br>
    <img style=" width: 456px; height: 191px;" alt=""
      src="images/settings/bad_hostname_ping_test.gif"><br>
    <br>
    The following screen would indicate a bad network connection at the
    GUI machine:<br>
    <br>
    <img style=" width: 465px; height: 189px;" alt=""
      src="images/settings/bad_network_ping_test.gif"><br>
    <br>
    Finally, the name may be resolved and the network may be good but
    the named host may not answer either because it is down or it is not
    properly connected to the network:<br>
    <br>
    <img style=" width: 501px; height: 186px;" alt=""
      src="images/settings/lost_host_ping_test.gif"><br>
    <br>
    <h3>Database Connection Test</h3>
    The Database Connection Test makes a comprehensive test of the
    current database settings by trying to access the DiFX job queue and
    getting a list of all jobs out of it (this is exactly what the Queue
    Browser does to access the queue data).&nbsp; It is run using the
    "Test Database" button.&nbsp; When run, the test forms a URL out of
    host name and port number (this URL is reported in parenthesis in
    the results panel), then attempts to create a connection using the
    URL, the user, and the password.&nbsp; If this is successful, the
    DiFX database is consulted to obtain a list of all queued
    jobs.&nbsp; The Database Connection Test reports the number of jobs
    in the queue and exits.<br>
    <br>
    <img style=" width: 646px; height: 188px;" alt=""
      src="images/settings/good_database_test.gif"><br>
    <h3><a name="Database_Remote_Access"></a>Problems with Database
      Remote Access</h3>
    The following is a list of some of the errors that might be produced
    by the Database Connection Test and what can be done about
    them.&nbsp; Note that these errors may also be reported in the
    Message Window as the GUI tries to access the DiFX queue in the
    database.<br>
    <code></code> <code></code><code></code><code><br>
      <br>
      <br>
    </code>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><code>SQLException:
        Communications link failure The last packet sent successfully to
        the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received
        any packets from the server.</code></div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
    </div>
    This error indicates that the connection to the remote mySQL
    database failed.&nbsp; Check that the DiFX host exits and in on the
    network (using the <a href="#Database_Ping_Test">Ping Test</a>).&nbsp;



    Then remote log into that host and see if mySQL is run:<br>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    </ul>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">ps -ef | grep mysql
</pre>
    Both <span style="font-style: italic;">mysql_safe</span> and <span
      style="font-style: italic;">mysqld</span> should be running.&nbsp;
    The latter is the mySQL server, the former is used to start it
    when/if it shuts down.&nbsp; In a proper installation of mySQL these
    programs should be running automatically after boot up.&nbsp; If
    they ARE running, see if a mySQL client can be run (the path may be
    different):<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
    </span>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>/usr/bin/mysql</pre>
    </div>
    If it cannot be run, this may indicate an incorrect or incomplete
    mySQL installation.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <pre style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">SQLException: Access denied for user 'difxw'@'10.1.2.45' (using password: YES)</pre>
    Access to the database can be denied for a number of reasons.&nbsp;
    Check your user name and password (these need to be mySQL user name
    and password, not necessarily the user name and password you use to
    remotely log into the DiFX host).&nbsp; If you can, run the mySQL
    client on the DiFX as root from the command line (you will require
    the root password):<br>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">/usr/bin/mysql -u root -p</pre>
    Then generate a list of all users and hosts recognized by mySQL:<br>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">mysql&gt; select user, host from mysql.user;</pre>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">+------+---------------------+<br>| user | host&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>+------+---------------------+<br>| difx | 10.1.2.45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| difx | 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| root | 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | localhost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| difx | localhost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| root | localhost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | swc02.usno.navy.mil |<br>| difx | swc02.usno.navy.mil |<br>| root | swc02.usno.navy.mil |<br>+------+---------------------+<br>9 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
    In this list somewhere should be the user name you are using paired
    with the GUI host name.&nbsp; Note that mySQL treats user/host pairs
    almost as separate users - you must designate both your user name
    and host as a "user".&nbsp; To do this, the following command will
    both "create" the user/host pair and give it access to all databases
    (note that "grant" is a complex command used for many things - you
    should consult mySQL documentation before using this command with
    reckless abandon):<br>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">mysql&gt; grant all privileges on *.* to 'difx'@'new.host.name';<br>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</pre>
    You should then see the user/host pair in the user list:<br>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">mysql&gt; select user, host from mysql.user;<br><br>+------+---------------------+<br>| user | host&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>+------+---------------------+<br>| difx | 10.1.2.45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| difx | 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| root | 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | localhost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| difx | localhost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| root | localhost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>| difx | new.host.name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |   &lt;---------------- HERE!!!!<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | swc02.usno.navy.mil |<br>| difx | swc02.usno.navy.mil |<br>| root | swc02.usno.navy.mil |<br>+------+---------------------+<br>10 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
    The user/host pair needs its own password specification - even if
    your user name already had a password, this is not enough!&nbsp; To
    specifiy the password for the new user/host pair (or to make sure
    your password is set properly on an existing user/host pair), do the
    following (replaced "PASSWORD" with your new password):<br>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">mysql&gt; set password for 'difx'@'new.host.name'=password( 'PASSWORD' );<br>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</pre>
    At this point we reach the limits of my personal mySQL knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <pre style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Database contains 0 jobs.</pre>
    This is not an error, however you may encounter this message.&nbsp;
    It simply means there are no jobs queued in the specified
    database.&nbsp; If this is not what you expect (because, for
    instance, you've recently queued something), check the value in the
    "DiFX Database" field.&nbsp; It should match your the name of the
    database where queuing is going on (which is probably "difxdb").<br>
