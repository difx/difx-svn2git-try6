Scripts for use with mpifxcorr software correlator 
http://astronomy.ivec.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/difx/index

and NRAO-DiFX 1.0
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~wbrisken/NRAO-DiFX-1.0/

All of the executable scripts have parameters that can be set in 3 
different ways:

1 - in the file correlator_default.py
    Parameters which are the same for all jobs should be placed here.

2 - in the file observation.py
    observation.py contains observation-specific parameters. It can also overwrite any parameter
    in the correlator_defaults file. The first line of the script should be
    from correlator_default import *

    It is usually placed in the working directory.

    other-wise simply put a script with that name in this directory.

3 - as arguments on the command line.

3 has precedence of 2 which has precedence over 1.


Any script can be run in 2 ways:

1 - from the command line (run without arguments for a help string)
2 - from a script (see pydifx.py)


A quick explanation of most of the scripts (All of the scripts have a docstring at the top.)
