COMMAND NAME:   fplot

SYNOPSIS:  Displays fringe plots attached to type 2 files

SYNTAX:    fplot [-x -h] [data file list]
		All option flags must appear before the data file list.
		The -x and -h flags are mutually exclusive, and enable
		xwindow display and hardcopy respectively, no default.

OPTION FLAGS:	-x
			Display the fringe plot(s) on the X-window display
			pointed to by the DISPLAY environment variable.
		-h
			Print a hardcopy of the fringe plot(s),

ARGUMENTS:	data file list
			A list of type-2 files, the fringe plots of which
			to display or print.  Fplot follows the standard 
			MkIV data file specification format.
			You may specify individual type-2 filenames,
			scan directories which contain data files,
			experiment directories, or any combination of
			these three.  In the latter two cases,
			fplot will descend the directory tree looking for
			data files to add to its internal list of files to
			process.  Beware of trying to specify too many
			files or scan directories, as it is possible to
			overflow the Unix argument list buffer on large
			experiments.  In such cases, specify the experiment
			directory instead.

ENVIRONMENT:	MK4_PRINTER, PRINTER

DESCRIPTION:

This program is designed to allow easy access to the fringe plots attached
to the type-2 files on disk, by FRNGE or fourfit.  Using the standard data
file specification format for MkIV programs, one can generate a selective
list of files to display or print.  The -x option displays the plots on
an Xwindow screen, and has the virtue of great speed.  One can flip through
many fringe plots very rapidly, and move both backwards and forwards in the
list of files to be displayed.  This capability is intended to save trees.

For those who need hardcopy printout, the -h option is provided.  The
plot is spooled using the "lpr" print spooler to an appropriate printer
identified by the support script "pplot_print".  (PRINTER takes precedence
over MK4_PRINTER unless you've redefined MK4_PRINTER.  And in any case you
can put your own pplot_print earlier in your PATH.)
