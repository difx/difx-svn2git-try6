COMMAND NAME:   fourmer

SYNOPSIS:  a program to join two scans into one

SYNTAX:  fourmer root-A root-B [msglev]

OPTION FLAGS:	none

ARGUMENTS:	root-A
			path to the root of one scan
		root-B
			path to the root of the second scan
		msglev
			an integer -3 .. 3, inclusive controlling the
			amount of commentary (less is more).

ENVIRONMENT:	HOPS_FOURMER_FG, HOPS_FOURMER_JOIN

DESCRIPTION:

Fourmer makes a best-effort attempt to join two scans into a single
scan.  This only makes sense if the data was captured at the same time
and if the channels are disjoint.  The channel names are renamed with
'A' or 'B' inserted following the frequency group identifier.

In theory the resulting scan data should be used by fourfit, but this
has not been extensively tested.  The results of fourmer may be again
combined by fourmer; however, note that various internal size limits
may be thereby exceeded.

The environment variable HOPS_FOURMER_FG may be used to override the
frequency group identifier with a new value.  The new scan name is
based on the common start from the two scans with 'JOIN' appended.
The environment variable HOPS_FOURMER_JOIN allows you to specify
something other than 'JOIN'.
